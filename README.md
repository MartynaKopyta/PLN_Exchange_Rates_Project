# PLN_Exchange_Rates_Project

This repo was created as a small project to understand web scraping better. 

I used Beautiful Soup to write a Python script that gets exchange rates of 1 PLN to a few other currencies from a web page that allowed this scraping. This first was a console project, which I also left available in the repo. Later, I asked ChatGPT to write some simple code to turn this into an app that uses HTML to display contents in a web browser on a local server. 

The console app can be run in a code editor of choice. To use the app with HTML, open the directory of the project in the terminal and type: python currency_app.py (assuming you have Python installed). You can open the local host directory that appears in the terminal in your browser to use.
